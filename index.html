                <hr>
                <p>
                  I have always been fascinated and interested in science and technology. 
                  My first university degree was in physics and mechanical engineering 
                  and in that time information technology(IT) was in its early days.
                  My interest and fascination with IT has grown with the fast emergence 
                  and application of this technology. 
                  
                    <br>
                    
                  I went back to college and university to learn more about this very 
                  important and useful technology and achieved degrees in computer 
                  science and computer networking.

                    <br>

                  I heard about Code Nation courses from friends and online and how 
                  good they are and  decided to catch this opportunity and gain new 
                  interesting skills in IT.
