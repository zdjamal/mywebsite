                    efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in
                    teams? </h2>

                <p>
                    Using MacBook Pro was powerful enough for this project. 
                    Software used i.e: Visual Studio Code and Trello perfectly fit for purpose they’ll been made.  
                    <br><br>
                    As a first time user, I haven’t got enough time and possibilities to find software drawbacks as we are using Mac’s only in Code Nation.  
                    Probably if I have chance to work with this software for a longer I could make a list of pros and cons. 
                    <br><br>
                    Doing this project in a team would be beneficial, for example, one of the team members could concentrate on finding sources and content over the internet, 
                    other could work on website layout, fonts etc. when rest of the team could concentrate on coding. Doing everything on my own was more challengeable but gave me more satisfaction for finishing it.

                <p>
                    Time management in project like this is very important but most important is knowledge about coding and proper planning from the first step of starting any project.
                <br><br>
                Fast computer is essential, as well as environment where were working. 
                Comfortable and silent place for working on a project would be also beneficial.  
                The one in the the main room of Code Nation is perfect for this job.

                    I think I could manage my time in a better way. 
                    <br>
                    From first minutes of the project, after sketching it in Trello, 
                    I should give myself deadline for each tasks to be  finished.  
                    <br>
                    Having a limited time for each tasks would help me to avoid backlog in my project.

                <p>
                    I have tested my blog on Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, on Mac and PC, also on Mozilla Firefox, Chrome and Brave on Android mobile and it appears good.
