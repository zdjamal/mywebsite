                    website? How? Could you have done it in

                        Using the right platform and the appropriate  software are crucial 
                        in order to develop and build successful and robust digital projects.
 
                    <br><br>
                    Using the apple platform for the first time to create my website was 
                    a great and rewarding experience. It is a powerful, reliable and 
                    easy to us platform. Tools such as VSC and Trello were also fit for purpose and helpful. 

                    <br><br>
                    Working as a team to create the project, we would designate roles and responsibilities 
                    for each member. The team manager would give tasks to team members with 
                    the relevant knowledge and skills to do each task

                <p>
                 There are many ways to improve productivity and efficiency 
                 while making digital projects including: 
                 using faster and robust hardware and software, 
                 working in a relaxed and friendly environment, 
                 time management and working in teams when possible and most 
                 importantly learn new and enhance exciting digital skills.

                    differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>

                <p>
                    Having a set time and deadlines for each task would have helped me 
                    in managing my time more efficiently and in a better way. <br>
                    For bigger and more complex digital project, 
                    working in a team and using tools such as Slack to collaborate 
                    would be definitely more efficient and helpful.

                <hr>
                <p>
                        I think it is a good practice to test digital solutions throughout 
                        its creation and test the final project on different platforms 
                        and environments if possible.<br><br>
                        I have tested my website on Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, on Mac and PC and it is working properly.
