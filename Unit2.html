                <p>
                    For my website and due to the time restriction, I have used simple web pages layout using numbered points for each question and included paragraphs bold and italic texts as well as appropriate images for the background and navigation buttons 
                    <br>
                    The content of the first web page (Home page) is a description about myself. The second, The third and fourth pages contain answers for Unit 1 and page five answers for Unit 2 of the assignment. I tried to use simple and understandable language and I gathered information using resources over the internet.

                    The best way to get around this is  first, get permission from the original author, second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.

                    There are people with special needs in terms of getting access to the internet and websites. One group are people with sight problems such as colour blinds, where high contrast, large, simple fonts are extremely important to help them surfing over the web. Talking web pages and text-to-speech are also very useful. 
                    <br>
                    Other group are people with hearing problems where i.e. subtitles in movies ore the only way to understand the content. No one should be excluded from access to the internet resources and websites, so this is a great opportunity for IT community to help people without it
