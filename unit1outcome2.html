                  <br> 
                  E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.

              <p>
                    This project of making my own website gave me a great opportunity and new experience 
                    in using new hardware, operating system, tools and software. 
                  <br><br>
                  I have to admit that using the MacBook Pro and the iOS for the first time 
                  changed my opinion about Windows OS and software in that iOS and the MackBook are smoother, faster and easier to use.
 
                  <br><br>
                  Using tools and software such as Visual Studio Code (VSC) and Trello for the first time 
                  was very helpful for creating my website. VSC’s menu is user friendly and made coding in html and css easy and fun as for using 
                  Trello for planning my project was a great and beneficial experience, it has an easy and user friendly user interface. 

                  <br><br>
                  The use of those IT tools cited above to create my first website 
                  was truly enjoyable, beneficial and helped me enhance my IT skills and I will definitely be using them in the future.

              <h2>1.2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>
                    The IT tools used to create my website were appropriate and very useful. VSC, 
                    which I used for the first time, comes with a user friendly 
                    interface and a code editor that can be used for major programming 
                    languages and was ideal for me to create HTML and CSS files for my website.
 
                  <br><br>
                  Trello was very helpful in planning my project, it’s simple to use and intuitive. Its  functionality and simplicity in terms of planning is great and 
                  Ability to make a drag-and-drop tasks list is its core function.

              <h2>1.2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why?
                  Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
              </h2>
              <hr>
              <p>
                    Considering the time restrictions, In would say that in general 
                    I am happy about the look and functionality of the website I created. 
                    Although it’s just a simple and static website, it matches the assignment 
                    requirements. To make it better I would add more functionality to the website 
                    such as animations, videos and some JavaScript to make it 
                    interactive and more appealing.

              <hr>
              <p>
                    Due to the time restrictions, I just managed to make a simple and static website. 
                    As improvement to my website I could add more features such as animated background, music, videos and some JavaScript 
                    to make the website more interactive.

              <h2>1.2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
              <hr>
              
              <p>
                    After planning my website using Trello, I used VSC to create the necessary file 
                    for my website including HTML pages and a CSS file
                    <br><br>
                    First, the necessary web pages were created without any formatting using HTML and the web pages content 
                    was added according to the assignment requirements and then a CSS file was used to do all the necessary formatting to keep the website consistent.
                    <br><br>
                    The file structure used was very effective to make sure the website is 
                    working properly and testing was conducted during the creation of the website 
                    to make sure it’s fit for purpose and matches the assignment’s requirements.
