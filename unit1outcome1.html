              <hr>
              <p>
                Information Technology (IT) plays a very important and integral role in 
                most aspects of life especially in the business sector. Indeed modern 
                businesses of all types and sizes rely in one way or another on IT to conduct 
                their business and achieve their goals. IT enables modern businesses to grow 
                quicker, deliver a better customer experience and save time and money.
            </p>
              <p>
                
                  Technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud 
                  computing are essential for modern businesses to understand their target 
                  market faster and more efficiently. Small businesses can survive and compete 
                  with big companies due to the advent of the internet and IT. 
                </p>
              <p>
                  
                Emails, Voice Over Internet Protocol(VOIP), text, video and audio chats are 
                means of communication between employees, customers and suppliers and a must 
                have technologies for modern businesses.
            </p>
              <p>
                  
                IT systems such as Inventory Management Systems (IMS), 
                Data Management Systems (DMS), Management Information Systems (MIS) 
                and many more are very useful and important for all types of modern 
                businesses to track the quality and availability of each item and 
                update information. DMS enables businesses to store and manage 
                a huge amount of data on servers and storage devices which can be 
                available and accessible by everyone in the company regardless of 
                their geographical locations. IT also enables companies managers 
                to analyse and make decisions based on information and analysis 
                provided by a MIS. By using data analysis, a system such as 
                Customer Relationship Management (CEM) can be used to manage and 
                improve a business’s relationship with current or potential customers.
            </p>
              <p>
                  
                More than ever, modern businesses are subjects to security threats and 
                breaches to financial data, customer information and other information 
                that may cause competitive advantages. IT plays a big role in protecting 
                businesses against security threats and vandalism by using tools such as 
                password protection, prevention and detection systems.

                  <strong>Customer Relationship Management:</strong><br />
                  CRM is an approach to manage a company’s relationship with current or 
                  potential customer. It uses data analysis about customer’s history with a 
                  company to improve business relationship with customers, specifically 
                  focusing on customer retention and ultimately driving sales growth.

                needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need 
                to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h2>
              <hr>
  
              <p>
                Communication and some IT skills as well as the willingness to learn and 
                improve are needed to complete digital projects successfully. The ability 
                to work as part of a team, positive attitude and open minded personalities 
                as well as proper planning and implementation using the wright and desirable 
                methods and software from the start are needed for the completion of digital 
                projects.
                Using tools such as Slack to communicate between team members to share ideas 
                and files anywhere-anytime or Trello board software (Kanban method) to 
                prepare a list of “to do, doing and done” where a plan of every step of 
                a project is created are examples of some of the tools and software that 
                can be used to complete a successful digital project. Splitting jobs between 
                team members taking into consideration each member's ability to assign each 
                part of the project to the right person are some of the methods that can be 
                used to ensure a digital project success. Finally, planning, making, managing 
                time, team working, error checking and testing are all part of a successful 
                digital project completion.

              <p>
                  
                Any digital project including creating a website have to be well planned for the start. 
                Many free and paid tools are available to use for planning and managing a project. 
                For my website, I have used Trello software to plan a list of “to do, doing and 
                done” tasks, the software features give a view of processes and progress.
                Link to my Trello board: <a href="https://trello.com/b/aSElCKJz/mywebsite">mywebsite</a>
                Appropriate software such as visual studio, finding the relevant content, 
                creating web pages layout, choosing the right fonts and colours etc. are all 
                essential for a professional and successful website.

                Many factors can cause digital projects to fail including human errors 
                such as lack of experience or negligence and hardware issues such as computer 
                interruption/failure. Poor team leading and cooperation and misinterpretation of

                For this project and as part of CodNation course ,

                Trello board to make a written plan for each step of my work i.e. “To do-doing-done”, 
                text editor to create text documents and Visual Studio Code Code for coding in

              <hr>
  
              <p>
                Using Trello board and its features such as its ability to change the content 
                and position of each board at any time was very helpful and useful in terms of 
                planning my project from the earliest stages, implementing ideas through board, 
                managing time for each part of the project.               </p>
  
              <p>
                  <strong>Git and GitHub:</strong><br />
                  Git, a distributed version-control for tracking changes in source code during 
                  software development, is designed for coordinating work among programmers but 
                  it can be used to track changes within any set of files. Github is an American 
                  company that provides hosting for software development version control using GIT. 
                  It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) 
                  functionality of GIT as well as its own functionality.
